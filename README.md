Work in progress implementing the data analysis from the paper.

Usage:

- Look at `Notebook.ipynb` to see plots, etc. The notebook assumes a file named `data.tif` to exist at the working directory.
- `neurenorm.py` contains the main code.
- `test.py` contains tests that the code is working as intended.
